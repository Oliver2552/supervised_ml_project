# Diabetes Prediction Project

## Overview

This project aims to predict whether an individual has diabetes (or not) based on several health-related predictors. The dataset used for this analysis contains information such as glucose levels, BMI, age, pregnancies, hereditary caclulations
and a few other variables.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Diabetes Dataset](link-to-dataset) sourced from [provide the source or dataset repository].

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Conducted an initial analysis of the dataset to understand its structure, missing values, and relationships between variables.
- Explored the distribution of predictor variables and their correlation with the outcome variable.
- Visualized the data through various plots and charts to gain insights.

## Data Preprocessing

Performed several preprocessing steps, including:

- Handling missing values.
- Identifying and handling outliers.
- Scaling and normalization of features.
- Feature engineering to enhance model performance.
- Addressing imbalanced data.

## Model Training and Evaluation

Trained and evaluated two models:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest (Ensemble)

### Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC-AUC

## Results

Compare the performance of the two models using the evaluation metrics. Interpret the results and discuss any notable findings.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction.git
